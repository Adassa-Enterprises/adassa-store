            <p>
                The company was established as an Information Technology (IT) company. 
                Currently, our main focus is on the development of desktop, web, 
                server and mobile software applications and IT security. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Applications we develop are usually business automation type 
                software that can be standalone, client-server or enterprise based.
            </p>
            <p>
                We do not believe in reinventing the wheel so we make extensive 
                use of existing open source software components and frameworks. 
                We make use of ubiquitous object oriented languages such as Java, C++
                and Python and all the relevant and related technologies such as web services.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are constantly expanding our expertise in business and 
                software development so we remain open to requests for products 
                and services that we do not presently offer.
